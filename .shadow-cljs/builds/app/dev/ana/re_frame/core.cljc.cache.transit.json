When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n *   the two functions can be used to create it.\n * \n *   The three arguments are:\n * \n *   - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n *   - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n *  flows required by this kind of node.\n *   - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n *  node (from the input data flows)\n * \n *   Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n *   will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n *   query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n *   associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n * \n *   Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n *   It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n *   can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n *   use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n * \n *   The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n * \n *  - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n *  - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n * \n *   and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n * \n *   When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n *   vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n *   then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n * \n *   The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n *   can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n *   of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \"flow into\" the\n *   `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n * \n *   So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n *   to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n *   `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n *   instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n * \n *   **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n *   and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n *   is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n * \n * \n *   **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n *      computation-fn)\n * \n *   This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n * \n *   When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n *   is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n *   one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n * \n *   The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n *   the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n *   this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n *   the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n * \n *   This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n *       [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n *        (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n * \n *   The associated computation function must be written\n *   to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n *      ....)\n * \n *   If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n *      (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n * \n *   then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n *   as the 1st argument:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n *       ...)\n * \n *   Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   is the equivalent of using this\n *   2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :query-id\n *      (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n *      a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n * \n *   **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :a-b-sub\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\n *      :<- [:b-sub]\n *      (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n *        {:a a :b b}))\n * \n *   This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n *   `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n * \n *   If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n *   as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n * \n *    #!clj\n *    (reg-sub\n *      :a-sub\n *      :<- [:a-sub]\n *      (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n *        ...))\n * \n *   For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n *   /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n * \n *   See also: `subscribe`\n *   \n */\nre_frame.core.reg_sub = (function re_frame$core$reg_sub(var_args){\nvar args__4742__auto__ = [];\nvar len__4736__auto___64837 = arguments.length;\nvar i__4737__auto___64838 = (0);\nwhile(true){\nif((i__4737__auto___64838 < len__4736__auto___64837)){\nargs__4742__auto__.push((arguments[i__4737__auto___64838]));\n\nvar G__64839 = (i__4737__auto___64838 + (1));\ni__4737__auto___64838 = G__64839;\ncontinue;\n} else {\n}\nbreak;\n}\n\nvar argseq__4743__auto__ = ((((1) < args__4742__auto__.length))?(new cljs.core.IndexedSeq(args__4742__auto__.slice((1)),(0),null)):null);\nreturn re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic((arguments[(0)]),argseq__4743__auto__);\n});\n\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic = (function (query_id,args){\nreturn cljs.core.apply.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(re_frame.subs.reg_sub,cljs.core.into.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$2(new cljs.core.PersistentVector(null, 1, 5, cljs.core.PersistentVector.EMPTY_NODE, [query_id], null),args));\n}));\n\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$maxFixedArity = (1));\n\n/** @this {Function} */\n(re_frame.core.reg_sub.cljs$lang$applyTo = (function (seq64751){\nvar G__64752 = cljs.core.first(seq64751);\nvar seq64751__$1 = cljs.core.next(seq64751);\nvar self__4723__auto__ = this;\nreturn self__4723__auto__.cljs$core$IFn$_invoke$arity$variadic(G__64752,seq64751__$1);\n}));\n\n/**\n * Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n *   time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

When a node of type `query-id` is needed,\n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n\n  The three arguments are:\n\n  - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n  - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n    flows required by this kind of node.\n  - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the\n    node (from the input data flows)\n\n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the\n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions\n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node.\n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes\n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the\n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n\n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n\n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that\n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function`\n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part\n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \\\"flow into\\\" the\n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways\n  to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a\n  `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and\n  instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n        computation-fn)\n\n  This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n  When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n  is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n  one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n  The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n  the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n  this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n  the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n\n  This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n  The associated computation function must be written\n  to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n        ....)\n\n  If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n        (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n\n  then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n  as the 1st argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n         ...)\n\n  Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  is the equivalent of using this\n  2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n        a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n          {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n  `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n  If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n  as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n          ...))\n\n  For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n\n  See also: `subscribe`\n  \"\n  {:api-docs/heading \"Subscriptions\"}\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub (into [query-id] args)))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n  time, reactively deliver a stream of values.

The duplicates check made after\n  'delete todo' event might be subtly different to that done after an\n  editing operation. Nice and efficient, but fiddly. A bug generator\n  approach.\n\n  So, instead, we create an `f` which recalculates ALL warnings from scratch\n  every time there is ANY change.

The other two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n        computation-fn)\n\n  This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n  When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n  is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n  one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n  The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n  the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n  this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n  the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n\n  This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n  The associated computation function must be written\n  to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n        ....)\n\n  If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n        (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n\n  then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n  as the 1st argument:\n\n      #!clj\n      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n         ...)\n\n  Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  is the equivalent of using this\n  2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n        a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n          {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n  `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n  If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n  as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n      #!clj\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n          ...))\n\n  For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n\n  See also: `subscribe`\n  "],"~$make-restore-fn",["^ ","^7<",null,"^5",["^ ","^6","re_frame/core.cljc","^7",978,"^8",7,"^9",978,"^:",22,"^7E",["^1S",["^7G",["^1S",[[]]]]],"^7H","This is a utility function, typically used in testing.\n\n  It checkpoints the current state of re-frame and returns a function which, when\n  later called, will restore re-frame to the checkpointed state.\n\n  The checkpoint includes `app-db`, all registered handlers and all subscriptions.\n  ","^7=","Miscellaneous"],"^S","^3U","^7=","Miscellaneous","^6","re_frame/core.cljc","^:",22,"^7B",["^1S",[[]]],"^7I",null,"^7F",["^1S",[null,null]],"^8",1,"^7?",false,"^7",978,"^7M","~$function","^9",978,"^7A",0,"^7N",true,"^7E",["^1S",["^7G",["^1S",[[]]]]],"^7H","This is a utility function, typically used in testing.\n\n  It checkpoints the current state of re-frame and returns a function which, when\n  later called, will restore re-frame to the checkpointed state.\n\n  The checkpoint includes `app-db`, all registered handlers and all subscriptions.\n  "],"~$clear-fx",["^ ","^7<",null,"^5",["^ ","^7=","Effect Handlers","^6","re_frame/core.cljc","^:",15,"^7>",["^ ","^7?",false,"^7@",1,"^7A",1,"^7B",[[],["^89"]],"^7E",["^1S",[[],["^89"]]],"^7F",["^1S",[null,null]]],"^8",7,"^7",478,"^9",478,"^7E",["^1S",["^7G",["^1S",[[],["^89"]]]]],"^7H","Unregisters effect handlers (presumably registered previously via the use of `reg-fx`).\n\n  When called with no args, it will unregister all currently registered effect handlers.\n\n  When given one arg, assumed to be the `id` of a previously registered\n  effect handler, it will unregister the associated handler.
